# XR-archaeology-server

This is the backend for XR-archaeology-app.

## To begin the admin interface and server [DEV]

1. Configure yarn setting of `ignore-engines` to be `true`, if the version of yarn is 1.

   ```bash
   yarn preinstall
   ```

2. Create MongoDB instance on the local host

   ```bash
   yarn devMongo
   ```

3. Open a new terminal and start `mongosh` command

   ```bash
   mongosh
   ```

   Note: If this is the first time to initiate a MongoDB locally, run:

   ```mongosh
   rs.initiate()
   ```

4. (optional) Create a admin user

   ```bash
   # require to input email and password in terminal
   yarn admin
   ```

4. Open a new terminal and start running the server

   ```bash
   yarn server:start
   ```

5. Open a new terminal and start running front-end

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

## To initialize the docker container

1. Create the mongodb container and start running the server

   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

2. Log on to mongo express
   go to <http://localhost:8081/>
   log on using credentials set in .env(ME_CONFIG_BASICAUTH_USERNAME, ME_CONFIG_BASICAUTH_PASSWORD)

## To run the docker container

yarn start
```

1. Log on to mongo express
   go to <http://localhost:8081/>
   log on using credentials set in .env(ME_CONFIG_BASICAUTH_USERNAME, ME_CONFIG_BASICAUTH_PASSWORD)
